                Saving your own seeds is a cost-effective way to access crop seed for future planting and to help maintain the planet's plant biodiversity. Whether you plant your own saved seeds, give them away to friends and neighbors, or distribute them through your organization, knowing the viability of your seeds is important. As a follow-up to the article in the January 2011 EC HO Asia Notes, Issue 8, titled "Building your own seed germination chamber for testing seed viability" ( www.echonet.org/repository#1003:d:Build Your Own Seed Germination Cabinet), this article will explore the details of several low-cost methods for testing seed viability.
                Seed viability is a measure of the percentage of seeds that are alive after storage. The greater the viability of your seeds, the fewer seeds will be needed to establish a desired number of plants in the field or nursery.

Seed viability can be tested in many easy ways. A seed germination test is probably the most simple: seeds are given the needed resources (air, water, warmth, and light) to germinate and grow into a seedling. Simply place seeds in the soil or in a pot of soil and see how many grow. However, one disadvantage of using soil, pots, and outdoor resources is environmental fluctuation that can cast doubt on the true viability of the seeds (did the seeds fail to germinate because they were dead, or because they were watered erratically, fell victim to fungal attack, got too hot, etc.?).

                Tillage practices: tillage is the manipulation of soil that promotes good germination of seeds and crop growth. Practices occur prior to planting (ploughing) but also during crop growth (weeding). The farmer’s strategy adopted for tillage in the field should be known.
Dates and frequency of weeding: the data collection protocol should record this information for each field. It can be beneficial in satellite image interpretation, as it will flag whether a field is or is not weedy. This may explain differences in spectral response between fields with the same crop and cropping calendar.
Nutrient management: this captures whether fertilizers (organic or inorganic) are applied, the quantity and the rate (periods) of application. Differences between fields may affect plant vigor and hence (again) may explain differences in spectral response.
Agricultural water management: information on the water management strategy adopted for each FMU should be collected.
